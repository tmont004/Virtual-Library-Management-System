if you have windows, do the following:::

to run this program you need to enter this command in terminal

g++ --version

if the version is bellow 10 you need to update the compiler, LibrarySytem.cpp uses c++17 features and it will not compile
this is not fun and it took me forever to do

after this you run

.\run.bat

if you see warnings, dont worry about it, its only errors that you need to worry about

after compilation you run the following command

.\my_program.exe

thats it.

::::::

if you have mac or linux, remove the .txt from the make file then run the following commands


make 

then 

.\my_program
